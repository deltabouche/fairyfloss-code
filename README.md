I made this back in October 2017, but since then, [@nopjmp](https://github.com/nopjmp) created a much more complete theme, [vscode-fairyfloss](https://github.com/nopjmp/vscode-fairyfloss) which is available on the Visual Studio Marketplace.

This is an incomplete adaptation of [@sailorhg](http://sailorhg.com/)'s [fairyfloss](https://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/) theme.
